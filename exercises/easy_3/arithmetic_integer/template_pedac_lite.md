(Understand the) Problem
------------------------

-  Inputs:
  - two positive integers
-  Output:
  - the result of the following operations on those two numbers:
    - addition, subtraction, product, quotient, remainder, and power

---

**Problem Domain:**
- arithmetic
- integers only
---

**Rules:**
- no validation necessary
---

**Implicit Requirements:**
- use a prompt method for hash rockets

---

**Clarifying Questions:**

1.
2.
3.

---

**Mental Model:**
- take two integers from the user, and show how you would apply various
  arithmetic to those two integers
---

Examples / Test Cases / Edge Cases
----------------------------------

**Examples:**

==> Enter the first number:
23
==> Enter the second number:
17
==> 23 + 17 = 40
==> 23 - 17 = 6
==> 23 * 17 = 391
==> 23 / 17 = 1
==> 23 % 17 = 6
==> 23 ** 17 = 141050039560662968926103---
