# Problem:
# - write a method that takes a string as an argument, and returns a new string
# that contains the original value using a staggered capitalization scheme in
# which every other character is capitalized, and the remaining characters are
# lowercase.
# Rules:
# - characters that are not letters should not be changed, but countWrite a method that takes a String as an argument, and returns a new String that contains the original value using a staggered capitalization scheme in which every other character is capitalized, and the remaining characters are lowercase. Characters that are not letters should not be changed, but count as characters when switching between upper and lowercase.
